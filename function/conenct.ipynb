    "The error message you're seeing — *\"unable to connect to server connection failed connection to server 127.0.0.1 fatal f fatal password\"* — indicates a **failed attempt to connect to a local server**, often due to an **incorrect password** or **authentication issue**. This is most common in **PostgreSQL** but can apply to other systems as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the possible causes and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **Common Causes and Fixes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Wrong Password**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error:** `FATAL: password authentication failed for user \"your_user\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you're entering the **correct password** for the database user.\n",
    "* If you're using an environment variable or `.env` file, double-check the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Wrong Username**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure the username you are using actually exists in the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **PostgreSQL Not Running**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start the PostgreSQL server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Linux\n",
    "sudo service postgresql start\n",
    "\n",
    "# Windows (Command Prompt)\n",
    "pg_ctl -D \"C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\version\\data\" start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **pg\\_hba.conf Misconfiguration**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Edit `pg_hba.conf` (usually in the `data` folder of PostgreSQL).\n",
    "* Make sure the local connection rule allows password authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "# Example\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Restart the PostgreSQL server after changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Incorrect Port**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Default PostgreSQL port is `5432`.\n",
    "* Ensure you're connecting to the correct one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U your_user -d your_database\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Check Example Command**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d mydb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will prompt for a password — make sure it’s the right one for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 **Resetting PostgreSQL Password**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've forgotten the password:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect as a superuser or local OS user (`postgres`).\n",
    "2. Run:\n",

    "Verify PostgreSQL 17 is actually installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to **Control Panel > Programs and Features** and see if \"PostgreSQL 17\" is listed.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Step 2: **Initialize the Database Manually**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `data` folder is missing, initialize it manually using `initdb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd \"C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\17\\bin\"\n",
    "initdb -D \"C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\17\\data\" -U postgres -W\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-U postgres` sets the default user.\n",
    "* `-W` will prompt for the password.\n",
    "* If you get a permissions error, try running Command Prompt as administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Step 3: **Set PostgreSQL as a Windows Service (Optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you initialized manually, PostgreSQL won’t be set as a Windows service. You can register it using:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Then start it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pg_ctl start -D \"C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\17\\data\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Step 4: **Check If It Was Deleted**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes antivirus or users accidentally delete it. Check the **Recycle Bin**, or try searching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path \"C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\17\" -Filter postgresql.conf\n",
